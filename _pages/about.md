[//]: # (This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template]&#40;h3ttps://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io&#41; and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages]&#40;https://pages.github.com&#41; is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme]&#40;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&#41; created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository]&#40;https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io&#41; right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com]&#40;http://stuartgeiger.com&#41;, which uses [this Github repository]&#40;https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io&#41;.)

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not directlyfamiliar with git, you can  edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
