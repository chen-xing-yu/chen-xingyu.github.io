Continuum robot has evolved as a novel treatment modality with better features over the traditional minimally invasive surgery, such as faster, safer, and more convenient intra-body interventions without wide incisions. They are designed to navigate
anatomical pathways through single-port access, e.g. natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery or minimal incisions. Continuum surgical robots have a fundamentally different structure than
conventional manipulators composed of discrete rigid links connected by joints. Their
ability to take the shape of 3D curves enables these robots to perform procedures
through smaller surgical corridors than would be possible with traditional robotic
mechanisms.
During the work in Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, I lead a small group of students and design two continuum robot, a vascular interventional surgical robot and a robotic bronchoscopy system.
