In this work, we propose an optimized transition structure to realize smooth and high efficiency conversion from the guided wave supported by a conventional rectangular waveguide (CRW) to the domino plasmon polaritons (DPPs) supported by a domino plasmonic waveguide (DPW) and vice versa in the X-band (8.2GHzâˆ¼12.4GHz). This transition structure consists of two tapered CRWs connected by a gradient domino array with optimized gradient heights and lateral widths. Experimental results of the S-parameters show excellent agreement with the simulations and the optimization scheme can be readily extended to other bands. Furthermore, a domino plasmonic power divider is implemented to demonstrate the application of the transition structure in the integration of conventional microwave circuits with plasmonic devices.
