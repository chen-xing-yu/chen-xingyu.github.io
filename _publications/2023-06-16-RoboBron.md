excerpt: 'Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is a minimally invasive and effective method for early lung cancer intervention. Robot assisted bronchoscopy offers improved precision, spatial flexibility, and reduced risk of cross-infection. This paper introduces a novel teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system and a three-stage procedure derived for robot-assisted bronchoscopy. The robotic mechanism allows for translation, rotation, bending of a bronchoscope, and as well as the control of a novel variable stiffness catheter for tissue sampling. Rapid prototype of the robotic system has been fully developed and characterized with in-silico and in-vivo animal experiments in this study. We conducted the studies to evaluate the robots design concept and feasibility of usage for transbronchial biopsy. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed robotic bronchoscopy system in enhancing accuracy and safety during bronchoscopy procedures.'

Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is a minimally invasive and effective method for early lung cancer intervention.
Robot assisted bronchoscopy offers improved precision, spatial flexibility, and reduced risk of cross-infection. This
paper introduces a novel teleoperated robotic bronchoscopy system and a three-stage procedure derived for robot-assisted
bronchoscopy. The robotic mechanism allows for translation, rotation, bending of a bronchoscope, and as well as the
control of a novel variable stiffness catheter for tissue sampling. Rapid prototype of the robotic system has been fully
developed and characterized with in-silico and in-vivo animal experiments in this study. We conducted the studies to
evaluate the robot's design concept and feasibility of usage for transbronchial biopsy. The results demonstrate the
potential of the proposed robotic bronchoscopy system in enhancing accuracy and safety during bronchoscopy procedures.
